3. OPERATORS
    ● ✅ Teach:
        𓈒 Arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, unary
        𓈒 typeof, instanceof
    ● ⚠️ Confusion:
        𓈒  !! value of truthiness
        𓈒 pre/post increment
    ● 🎯Practice:
        𓈒 logic condition quizzes
        𓈒 scoring logic with ternary

1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators

Used for mathematical calculations.

Operator	Meaning	Example
+	  Addition	    10 + 5 → 15
-	  Subtraction	10 - 5 → 5
*	Multiplication	10 * 5 → 50
/	Division	    10 / 5 → 2
%	Modulus (remainder)	10 % 3 → 1
**	Power	        2 ** 3 → 8


2️⃣ Comparison Operators

Compare two values and return true / false.

Operator	Meaning
==	        Equal (value only)
===	        Strict equal (value + type)
!=	        Not equal
!==	        Strict not equal
< > <= >=	Relational


3️⃣ Logical Operators

Used to combine conditions.

Operator	Meaning
&&	        AND
!           NOT

4️⃣ Assignment Operators

Used to assign values.


5️⃣ Unary Operators
Work on single operand.

6️⃣ typeof Operator
Returns data type as string.

typeof 10        // "number"
typeof "Hello"   // "string"
typeof true      // "boolean"
typeof undefined // "undefined"
