📦 1. Variables & Declarations

    ● ✅ Teach:
        𓈒 var, let, const
        𓈒 Scope (global, block, functional)
        𓈒 Reassignment, redeclaration
        𓈒 Temporal Dead Zone
        𓈒 Hoisting impact per type
          
    ● ⚠️ Common Confusion:
        𓈒  why var leaks outside block but let doesn't
        𓈒 why const allowes changing object properties

    ● 🧠 Mindset: 
        𓈒 Think of variables as containers scoped by prupose 

    ● 🎯Usage:
        𓈒 Base of all JS, mandatory in functions, loops, API logic
